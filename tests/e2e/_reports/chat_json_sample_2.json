{"response":"Here are three pros and three cons of microservices:\n\nPros:\n- Independent deployment: Services can be released, rolled back, and scaled without touching the whole system.\n- Fault isolation and resilience: A failure in one service is less likely to take down the entire application.\n- Team autonomy and tech flexibility: Teams can choose the best language, framework, and release cadence for each service.\n\nCons:\n- Operational complexity: More services mean more infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and incident handling.\n- Distributed systems challenges: Network latency, service discovery, retries, and debugging across boundaries add difficulty.\n- Data consistency issues: Managing transactions and eventual consistency across services is hard and requires careful design.","session_id":"default","reasoning_used":"gpt-5","facts_extracted":0,"context_used":{"profile_name":"User","interaction_count":0,"conversation_length":10,"facts_in_session":0,"using_client_memory":false}}
