Soccer Overview

1. What is Soccer?
Soccer, also known as football in most of the world, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players. The objective is to score more goals than the opponent by getting the ball into the opposing team’s net using any part of the body except the hands and arms (goalkeepers are the exception).

2. Basic Rules
A standard soccer match is played in two halves of 45 minutes each, with a short halftime break. Play is mostly continuous, and the clock does not stop for most interruptions. A goal is scored when the whole ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar.

Common rule elements include:
- Fouls: Physical contact that is careless, reckless, or uses excessive force, as well as handball by outfield players, can result in free kicks or penalty kicks.
- Cards: Referees use yellow cards to caution players and red cards to send players off the field.
- Offside: An attacking player is offside if they are nearer to the opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last defender at the moment the ball is played to them, with some exceptions. This prevents attackers from simply waiting near the goal.

3. Player Positions
Each team has eleven players, typically organized as:
- Goalkeeper: The only player allowed to use hands within their own penalty area; their main job is to stop shots on goal.
- Defenders: Protect the area near their own goal and try to block attacks.
- Midfielders: Link defense and attack, often responsible for passing, controlling the tempo, and winning the ball.
- Forwards (Strikers): Focus mainly on creating and converting goal-scoring opportunities.

4. Major Competitions
Soccer is the world’s most popular sport, with many professional leagues and tournaments, including:
- FIFA World Cup: A global national-team tournament held every four years, considered the most prestigious competition in soccer.
- UEFA Champions League: A yearly club competition in Europe featuring many of the strongest professional teams.
- Domestic Leagues: National leagues such as the English Premier League, La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy, and others.

Soccer’s global reach, simple equipment needs, and continuous flow of play make it one of the most widely played and watched sports on the planet.
