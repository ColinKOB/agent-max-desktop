# OpenAI GPT-5 Pricing (Updated 2025)
This page tracks OpenAI GPT-5 pricing and compares it with 116 competitor models. Prices are shown per 1M tokens (cost per token) with clear examples so you can estimate spend quickly.

## Current Prices (per 1,000 tokens)
* Some models use tiered pricing based on prompt length. Displayed prices are for prompts ≤ 200k tokens.

## What does "cost per token" mean?
Tokens are the basic units that AI models use to process text. Generally, 1,000 tokens ≈ ~750 words. The cost per token determines how much you pay for each unit of text processed by the model.
Formula: Total Cost = (tokens / 1,000) × price per 1K tokens

```
Total Cost = (tokens / 1,000) × price per 1K tokens
```


## Examples
Example usage with GPT-5: A 500-word prompt + 300-word response ≈ ~1,067 tokens total.
- • 1,000 tokens ≈ ~750 words of text
- • Short email: ~200-400 tokens
- • Blog post: ~1,000-3,000 tokens
- • Research paper: ~10,000+ tokens
GPT-5 Cost Example:
1,000 input tokens + 500 output tokens = $0.006250
